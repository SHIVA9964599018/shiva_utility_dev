• A. Structured data 
• B. Semi-structured data 
• C. Both of the above Most Voted 
• D. None of the above 
• Correct Answer: C 
Note: Why is FLATTEN also used in Structured Types?  
Because Snowflake's Structured Types (structured data) have internally nested complex 
structures, they are difficult to query directly using general SQL queries. Currently, the 
FLATTEN function performs the following roles: - Convert nested structures into table form 
for easy search. - Internal composite elements (STRUCTURED ARRAY, STRUCTURED 
OBJECT, MAP internal elements) are expanded into separate rows to enable querying. In 
other words, the FLATTEN function is essential in Snowflake's Structured Types (explicitly 
structured complex data), not general table data.

Which URL type should be used for custom applications that need to access unstructured data 
files? 
A. Scoped URL 
B. File URL  
C. Pre-signed URL 
D. Relative URL 
Ans: B 
The same link, https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/unstructured-intro , it says the same 
about Scoped URL: Ideal for use in custom applications, for providing unstructured data to other 
accounts through a share, or for downloading and analysis of unstructured data in Snowsight. 
Hence, A could be good, as well. But since the access is a little more restrictive: Recommended for 
file administrators to give scoped access to data files to specific roles in the same account. Provide 
access to the files with a view that retrieves scoped URLs. Only roles that have privileges on the 
view can access the files. Snowflake records information in the query history about who uses a 
scoped URL to access a file, and when. And, since in the question, we do not have any mention 
related to the access, B is the answer.

resources and auto-scaling when there is increased concurrency? 
A. WAREHOUSE_SIZE = LARGE

C. MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT =10 
D. ENABLE_QUERY_ACCELERATION = TRUE

ENABLE_QUERY_ACCELERATION is designed to improve performance for queries that experience 
high concurrency or large data scans without requiring additional manual scaling of resources. This 
feature dynamically allocates additional resources as needed for certain queries, avoiding both 
over-provisioning (which wastes resources) and scaling the number of clusters.

A. They are optimized for large-scale analytical aggregations only 
B. They enforce primary and foreign key constraints for OLTP-like use cases  
C. They cannot be joined with regular Snowflake tables

What are Hybrid Tables? 
• Hybrid Tables are Snowflake’s row-based storage tables, optimized for low-latency, 
high-concurrency transactions. 
• They combine: 
o OLTP features (fast inserts, updates, deletes, referential integrity) 
o OLAP features (query optimization, scalability, integration with analytical tables). 
Ref: Snowflake Docs – Hybrid Tables 
What happens when you use PARSE_JSON(NULL) or PARSE_JSON('') in Snowflake? 
A. Both return SQL NULL  
B. Both return empty JSON object {} 
C. Both return JSON string "NULL" 
D. Both return error 
Ans: A 
What happens when you run PARSE_JSON('NULL') (with quotes) in Snowflake? 
A. It returns SQL NULL 
B. It returns JSON NULL 
C. It returns JSON string "NULL"  
D. It returns error 
Ans: C 
How does FLATTEN handle NULL values in JSON? 
A. It ignores NULL values completely 
B. It raises an error 
C. It outputs a row with VALUE = NULL  
D. It converts NULL into string "NULL" 
Ans: C 
PARSE_JSON Behavior with NULL and Blank Strings 
• PARSE_JSON(NULL) returns SQL NULL — because no input is provided. 
• PARSE_JSON('') (empty string) also returns SQL NULL, as it's invalid JSON. 
• PARSE_JSON('null') (literal string "null") returns a JSON null (stored as null, not SQL NULL). 
Reference: 
The docs state: 
“If the input is NULL, the output will also be NULL. However, if the input string is null, it is 
interpreted as a VARIANT null value; … the result is not a SQL NULL but a real value used to 
represent a null value in semi-structured formats.” 
FLATTEN Behavior with NULL Values 
The FLATTEN table function explodes JSON/VARIANT values into multiple rows. Specifically: 
• When flattening, if OUTER => TRUE, rows that cannot be expanded (e.g., because the 
value is NULL or missing) still produce one row, where KEY, INDEX, and VALUE columns 
show NULL. 
• If OUTER => FALSE, such rows are omitted entirely. 
From the docs: 
“If FALSE, any input rows that cannot be expanded … are completely omitted … If TRUE, exactly 
one row is generated for zero-row expansions (with NULL in the KEY, INDEX, and VALUE columns).”
